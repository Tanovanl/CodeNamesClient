# Project Title: Code Names

## Description

Code Names is a web application developed using JavaScript, npm, and React. It is a single-developer project, currently being developed by Tanovanl. The application is designed to be interactive and user-friendly.

## Game Information

Code Names is a game where players guess which words in a set are related to a hint-word given by another player. The game is divided into two teams: red and blue. Each team has a "spymaster" who knows the secret identities of 25 agents. Their teammates know the agents only by their codenames.

In the game, there are cards with different colors: RED, BLUE, BLACK, and GRAY. Each color represents a different type of card: agent, bystander, or assassin. The RED and BLUE cards represent the agents of the respective teams. The BLACK card represents the assassin, and the GRAY cards are innocent bystanders.

The spymasters take turns giving one-word clues that can point to multiple words on the board. Their teammates try to guess words of the right color while avoiding those that belong to the opposing team. The game ends when all of one team's agents are identified (winning the game for that team), or when one team identifies the assassin (losing the game immediately).
